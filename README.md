🚀 Code Runner

Execute code in multiple languages directly from the browser.
A lightweight and scalable platform for running user-submitted code securely with backend execution support.

📌 Overview

Code Runner is an interactive platform where users can write, run, and test code inside a web interface.
The system sends the code to the backend, executes it in a safe environment, and returns the output instantly.

🎯 Perfect for:

1.Online coding practice
2.Learning programming
3.Building an online judge
4.Interview preparation tools
5.Education & training portals

✨ Features
Feature	Description
📝 Code Editor	Highly responsive editor with syntax highlighting
🧠 Language Support	Supports multiple languages (JS, TS, Python, C/C++, R, Ruby, php)
⚙️ Backend Execution	Code compiled/executed securely
📤 Input Support	Users can provide custom input
📄 Output Handling	Shows output, errors, and execution messages
🛡️ Security Layer	Executes code in isolated environment
🎛️ Pluggable Architecture	Add more languages anytime
🧩 Tech Stack
Layer	Technology
Frontend	React / Tailwind / CodeMirror (or Monaco Editor)
Backend	Node.js, Express.js
Code Execution	Child Process, Docker (optional), Compiler/Interpreters
Additional Tools	Socket.io (for live), JWT (if auth added)


⚙️ How It Works (Flow)

✍️ User writes code in the browser editor.
📩 Code + Language + Input sends to backend using API.
⚙️ Backend executes code using child process or Docker container.
📤 Output / Errors returned to UI and displayed.

🚀 Installation & Run Locally
1️⃣ Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/Harikrishnang-cloud/code-runner.git
cd code-runner

2️⃣ Setup Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm start

3️⃣ Setup Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev


🎉 App runs on:

Frontend → http://localhost:5173
Backend  → http://localhost:1729

🔌 API Routes
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/run	Execute code and return output
POST	/compile	(optional) compile first, then run
Sample Request Body
{
  "language": "javascript",
  "code": "console.log('Hello World')",
  "input": ""
}

🧪 Language Execution Logic
Language	Command
JavaScript	node code.js
Python	python3 code.py
C	gcc code.c -o code && ./code
C++	g++ code.cpp -o code && ./code
🔐 Security Considerations

🚫 Never execute code directly without sandboxing
Recommended:

Docker container per request
CPU timeouts
Memory limits
Block filesystem access
Disable infinite loops (timeout handler)

📈 Future Enhancements

User authentication system
Save & share code snippets
Execution history logs
Leaderboard + challenges
Realtime interview mode
Compile & run inside Docker
AI code assistant integration
